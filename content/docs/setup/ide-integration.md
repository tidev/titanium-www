title: IDE Integration
description: Install the Titanium package for Visual Studio Code, Pulsar, or a JetBrains IDE.
---

You do not need a special editor to develop Titanium apps. A project is
JavaScript, XML and TSS, and the Titanium CLI does the building, so any editor
will do.

For an integrated experience, three editors have a Titanium package: it builds
and runs your app on a simulator or device without leaving the window, generates
Alloy files, and streams the build log. Visual Studio Code and the JetBrains
plugin debug as well.

:::

TiDev maintains the first two. The JetBrains plugin is a community project.

All three drive the Titanium CLI you installed on the setup page for your
machine, and inherit its requirements, including **Node.js 22.19.0 or 24.x**.

## Visual Studio Code

The extension is **Titanium**, published by TiDev on the
[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tidev.titanium-sdk).

Install it from a terminal:

```sh
code --install-extension tidev.titanium-sdk
```

Or open the Extensions view, search for `Titanium`, and pick the one published
by TiDev.

It needs Visual Studio Code 1.100.0 or newer.

The extension loads when the folder you open contains a `tiapp.xml`. Open a
project directory rather than a parent folder holding several, or its commands
will not appear in the Command Palette.

### What it adds

A **Titanium view** in the Activity Bar lists the platforms you can build for
and the targets under each: simulators, emulators, and connected devices. Build
commands are available inline on a target and on its right-click menu.

`Titanium: Build` starts a build and `Titanium: Stop` ends one.

| Command                             | macOS               | Windows and Linux    |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| `Titanium: Build`                   | `cmd` `alt` `enter` | `ctrl` `alt` `enter` |
| `Titanium: Stop`                    | `cmd` `alt` `.`     | `ctrl` `alt` `.`     |
| `Titanium: Open related view`       | `cmd` `alt` `v`     | `ctrl` `alt` `v`     |
| `Titanium: Open related style`      | `cmd` `alt` `s`     | `ctrl` `alt` `s`     |
| `Titanium: Open related controller` | `cmd` `alt` `x`     | `ctrl` `alt` `x`     |
| `Titanium: Open related files`      | `cmd` `alt` `a`     | `ctrl` `alt` `a`     |

The three "open related" commands move between an Alloy controller, its view and
its style without going through the file tree.

`Titanium: Generate Alloy controller` and its siblings write models, views,
styles, widgets and migrations where Alloy expects them.
`Titanium: Create application`, `Titanium: Create module` and
`Titanium: Create keystore` wrap the CLI's creation commands, and
`Titanium: Fix environment issues` reports what your machine is missing.

The extension contributes a `titanium` debug type, so you can set breakpoints in
your JavaScript and step through a running app rather than reading log output.

### Settings worth knowing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `titanium.general.displayBuildCommandInConsole` defaults to `true`, and the
> command it writes to the output channel includes password arguments. Turn it
> off before sharing your screen, recording a build, or pasting output into an
> issue.

```json
{
  "titanium.general.displayBuildCommandInConsole": false,
  "titanium.build.liveview": true,
  "titanium.general.logLevel": "info",
  "titanium.android.keystorePath": "/Users/you/keystores/myapp.keystore",
  "titanium.android.keystoreAlias": "myapp"
}
```

`titanium.build.liveview` is on by default and reloads the running app when you
save. The two `keystore` settings save re-entering the path and alias on every
Android package build; the password is asked for each time and is not stored
here.

## Pulsar

[Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/) is the community-maintained continuation of
Atom, which GitHub retired in December 2022. The Titanium package for it is
`titanium`, maintained at
[tidev/pulsar-titanium](https://github.com/tidev/pulsar-titanium).

Install it from Pulsar: **Preferences** or **Settings**, then **Install**, then
search for `titanium`.

Or from a terminal:

```sh
pulsar --package install pulsar-titanium
```

### What it adds

A **toolbar** across the top of the editor, which is the main difference from
the VS Code extension. It carries the build and run control, platform and target
selectors, code signing and keystore configuration, a LiveView toggle, an info
panel for the active project, the component generator, and the console toggle.

| Command                   | Keymap               | What it does                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `appc:build`              | `ctrl` `alt` `enter` | Build with the selected configuration |
| `appc:stop`               | None                 | Stop the running build                |
| `appc:console`            | None                 | Toggle the console                    |
| `appc:generate`           | None                 | Generate an Alloy file or component   |
| `appc:take-screenshot`    | None                 | Screenshot the running device         |
| `appc:clean`              | `ctrl` `alt` `k`     | Clean the project directory           |
| `appc:open view`          | `ctrl` `alt` `v`     | Open the related Alloy XML file       |
| `appc:open style`         | `ctrl` `alt` `s`     | Open the related TSS file             |
| `appc:open controller`    | `ctrl` `alt` `x`     | Open the related JavaScript file      |
| `appc:open close related` | `ctrl` `alt` `a`     | Toggle all three related files        |

> [!NOTE]
> The `appc:` prefix is left over from Appcelerator and does not mean the
> package needs the retired `appc` CLI. Enable **Use ti commands** in the
> package settings so builds run through the Titanium CLI.

The package also provides autocomplete and hyperclick, so Alloy identifiers
resolve to the file that defines them.

Like the VS Code extension, the console prints the command it is running by
default. Those commands carry signing credentials on distribution builds, so
turn it off in the package settings before sharing your screen.

## JetBrains IDEs

> [!NOTE]
> This one is a community project, not TiDev's.
> [devloopsnet/titanium-jetbrains](https://github.com/devloopsnet/titanium-jetbrains)
> maintains it, Apache-2.0, and its Marketplace listing is from an unverified
> vendor. It is young: first released in July 2026.

The plugin is **Titanium** on the
[JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/32945-titanium).
Install it from your IDE: **Settings**, then **Plugins**, then **Marketplace**,
and search for `Titanium`.

It needs a 2024.3 or newer IntelliJ-Platform IDE, and it is a port of the VS
Code extension, so most of what that does has an equivalent here.

### What it adds

Builds run as an IDE **run configuration** rather than a command, so the usual
run and stop controls drive them and `tiapp.xml` is what marks a folder as a
Titanium project. There is a build-explorer tool window, `ti create` wizards for
apps and modules wired into **File, New, Project**, the Alloy generators, and
SDK install and update management.

Editor support goes further than the other two in one place: `.tss` gets real
highlighting and completion rather than being mapped onto CSS, Alloy views get
XML completion, and related controller, view and style files are reachable from
gutter markers.

> [!TIP]
> It runs on every IntelliJ-Platform IDE, including the free Community editions
> and Android Studio. JavaScript completion inside Alloy controllers is the one
> part that needs the bundled JavaScript plugin, so it appears on WebStorm,
> IDEA Ultimate, PhpStorm and PyCharm Professional and is absent elsewhere.
> Everything else works either way.

The debugger connects over the Chrome DevTools Protocol and handles breakpoints,
stepping and local variables. It is **experimental**: expression evaluation and
source-map fidelity are not finished, and iOS additionally needs
`ios-webkit-debug-proxy`.

One thing it does better than the VS Code extension: it echoes the build command
to the console with **passwords masked**, so the warning above about
`displayBuildCommandInConsole` has no equivalent here.

## Other editors

There is no Titanium package for any other editor, and the Atom package is not
an option: Atom itself is gone, and Pulsar is where that work continued.

JavaScript works everywhere and Alloy views are XML. The one gap is TSS. If
your editor lets you map an extension to a language, point `.tss` at CSS and
styles will highlight sensibly.

Build from a terminal:

```sh
ti build --platform android
```
