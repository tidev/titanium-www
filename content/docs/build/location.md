Location needs permission, and the permission has kinds: while-in-use or
always, and on iOS precise or approximate. Ask for the least you need.

```js
if (!Ti.Geolocation.hasLocationPermissions(Ti.Geolocation.AUTHORIZATION_WHEN_IN_USE)) {
  Ti.Geolocation.requestLocationPermissions(Ti.Geolocation.AUTHORIZATION_WHEN_IN_USE, (e) => {
    if (e.success) {
      locate();
    }
  });
} else {
  locate();
}
```

`tiapp.xml` needs the matching usage string on iOS:

```xml
<ios>
  <plist>
    <dict>
      <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
      <string>Show which notes were written near you.</string>
    </dict>
  </plist>
</ios>
```

Asking for `AUTHORIZATION_ALWAYS` is a much bigger request, is reviewed harder,
and on iOS the user is asked again later whether they meant it. Do not request
it for a feature that works while the app is open.

## One position

```js
function locate() {
  Ti.Geolocation.getCurrentPosition((e) => {
    if (!e.success) {
      Ti.API.error(`location failed: ${e.error}`);
      return;
    }
    const { latitude, longitude, accuracy } = e.coords;
    Ti.API.info(`${latitude}, ${longitude} +/- ${accuracy}m`);
  });
}
```

`accuracy` on the result is a radius in metres, and it is the number that
decides whether a fix is usable. A first fix indoors can be several hundred
metres wide; treat anything above your tolerance as "not yet" rather than as an
answer.

## Tracking

```js
Ti.Geolocation.accuracy = Ti.Geolocation.ACCURACY_HIGH;
Ti.Geolocation.distanceFilter = 10;

function onLocation(e) {
  if (!e.success) return;
  Ti.API.info(`moved to ${e.coords.latitude}, ${e.coords.longitude}`);
}

Ti.Geolocation.addEventListener('location', onLocation);
```

`distanceFilter` is metres of movement before another event, and it is the
single most effective thing you can set: without it you get an event per fix,
which is a battery complaint waiting to happen.

**Remove the listener when the screen goes away.** Location updates continue
while a listener is attached, whether or not anything is looking at them.

```js
win.addEventListener('close', () => {
  Ti.Geolocation.removeEventListener('location', onLocation);
});
```

Set `accuracy` to the loosest value that works. `ACCURACY_HIGH` powers the GPS
radio; a "which city" feature does not need it.

## Addresses

`reverseGeocoder` turns coordinates into an address and `forwardGeocoder` does
the reverse. Both are network calls against a platform service, so they fail
offline and are rate limited:

```js
Ti.Geolocation.reverseGeocoder(latitude, longitude, (e) => {
  if (e.success && e.places.length) {
    Ti.API.info(e.places[0].address);
  }
});
```

## Maps

Maps are **not** in the core SDK. `ti.map` is a module, maintained by TiDev,
and it wraps Google Maps on Android and MapKit on iOS.

```
<modules>
  <module platform="android">ti.map</module>
  <module platform="iphone">ti.map</module>
</modules>
```

```js
const Map = require('ti.map');

const view = Map.createView({
  mapType: Map.NORMAL_TYPE,
  region: { latitude: 51.5, longitude: -0.12, latitudeDelta: 0.05, longitudeDelta: 0.05 },
  annotations: [
    Map.createAnnotation({ latitude: 51.5, longitude: -0.12, title: 'Here' })
  ]
});
win.add(view);
```

Android additionally needs a Google Maps API key in `tiapp.xml`, and a build
without one shows an empty grid rather than an error. If your map is blank grey
squares, that is the reason.

See [using modules](/docs/build/modules) for installing it, and the module's
own reference for the full API.
