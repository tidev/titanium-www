description: The three layout modes, the two sizing constants, and the precedence order that decides which of your properties wins.
since: 13.4.0

Titanium positions a view from properties you set on it: `top`, `left`,
`right`, `bottom`, `center`, `width`, `height`. Which of them apply depends on
one property on the **parent**: its `layout`.

There are three modes, and the default is the one people trip over.

## The three layout modes

`composite` is the default. Children are pinned to the parent's edges, and a
child with no positioning properties at all is centred.

`vertical` stacks children top to bottom in the order you add them.

`horizontal` places them left to right, wrapping onto a new row when they run
out of width.

```js
const win = Ti.UI.createWindow({ backgroundColor: 'white' });

const stack = Ti.UI.createView({
  layout: 'vertical',
  top: 40,
  width: '80%',
  height: Ti.UI.SIZE
});

stack.add(Ti.UI.createLabel({ text: 'First', top: 10 }));
stack.add(Ti.UI.createLabel({ text: 'Second', top: 10 }));
stack.add(Ti.UI.createLabel({ text: 'Third', top: 10 }));

win.add(stack);
win.open();
```

`layout` is set on the container, never on the child. A child cannot ask to be
stacked; its parent decides.

## Sizing: SIZE, FILL, and numbers

`width` and `height` each take one of four kinds of value.

| Value | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `Ti.UI.SIZE` | As large as the content needs, and no larger |
| `Ti.UI.FILL` | As large as the parent allows |
| A number | That many units. `120` is 120dp with the template's default unit |
| A string | An explicit unit or a percentage: `'120dp'`, `'50%'` |

A plain number is in whatever `ti.ui.defaultunit` says in `tiapp.xml`, which
`ti create` sets to `dp`. Density-independent pixels, so `120` is the same
physical size on any screen. Write `'120px'` if you really mean device pixels,
which you rarely do.

### What a view does when you say nothing

Leave `width` and `height` unset and each view falls back to its own default,
which is `SIZE` for things that wrap content and `FILL` for things that own a
region:

| View | Default width | Default height |
| ---- | ------------- | -------------- |
| `Label`, `Button`, `Switch`, `ImageView` | SIZE | SIZE |
| `ActivityIndicator`, `Picker` | SIZE | SIZE |
| `TextField`, `TextArea`, `SearchBar` | FILL | SIZE |
| `Slider`, `ProgressBar`, `Toolbar` | FILL | SIZE |
| `ScrollView`, `ScrollableView`, `WebView` | FILL | FILL |
| `ListView`, `TableView`, `TabGroup` | FILL | FILL |

Read off the iOS layout code, where these are declared. Android reaches the
same answers through each native widget's own measurement rather than a
declared default, so treat the table as the shape of the behaviour and set
`width` and `height` yourself wherever it matters.

A plain `View` declares neither. Give it a size, or give it children and
`Ti.UI.SIZE`.

## Composite layout, and why your property was ignored

In composite layout you can over-specify a view: `height`, `top`, `center` and
`bottom` can all be set, and they cannot all be honoured. Rather than erroring,
Titanium applies a fixed precedence and silently drops the rest.

**Vertically the order is `height`, `top`, `center.y`, `bottom`.** The two
highest-precedence properties you set are the two that win.

| What you set | What happens |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| `height` and `top` | Positioned `top` from the parent's top, at that height. `center.y` and `bottom` ignored |
| `height` and `center.y` | Centred on `center.y`, at that height. `bottom` ignored |
| `height` and `bottom` | Positioned `bottom` from the parent's bottom, at that height |
| `top` and `bottom` | Both edges pinned. **Height is whatever is left between them** |
| `top` and `center.y` | Top edge pinned, centre pinned, height implied. `bottom` ignored |
| `top` only | Pinned from the top, at the view's default height |
| `bottom` only | Pinned from the bottom, at the view's default height |
| none of them | Centred vertically, at the view's default height |

Horizontally it works the same way, with the order `width`, `left`,
`center.x`, `right`.

That table is the answer to most "why is my view the wrong size" questions.
Setting `top`, `bottom` **and** `height` does not stretch anything: `height`
outranks `bottom`, so the view sits at the top with the height you asked for.
Drop the `height` and the two pins size it.

:::missing 4:3

The same view rendered twice on an iPhone simulator, side by side: on the left
`top: 20, bottom: 20, height: 100` sitting at the top of its parent, on the
right the same view with `height` removed, stretched between both pins.

## Vertical layout

Children stack in the order added. A child's `top` is the gap above it and its
`bottom` is the gap below, so the space between two children is the upper
one's `bottom` plus the lower one's `top`.

```js
const win = Ti.UI.createWindow({ backgroundColor: 'white', layout: 'vertical' });

win.add(Ti.UI.createLabel({ text: 'Title', top: 60, left: 20 }));
win.add(Ti.UI.createLabel({ text: 'Subtitle', top: 8, left: 20 }));
win.add(Ti.UI.createView({ height: 1, width: Ti.UI.FILL, top: 16, backgroundColor: '#ccc' }));

win.open();
```

Horizontally each child still behaves as it would in composite layout, which is
why `left: 20` works above and why a child with no horizontal properties is
centred.

> [!WARNING]
> A child with `height: Ti.UI.FILL` in a vertical layout takes everything left
> over, and every child after it gets nothing. One `FILL` child per vertical
> container, and put it last unless you mean to push the rest off screen.

## Horizontal layout

Children run left to right. **Wrapping is on by default**: when a child does
not fit in the current row it starts a new one, and each row is as tall as its
tallest child.

```js
const tags = Ti.UI.createView({
  layout: 'horizontal',
  top: 40,
  width: '90%',
  height: Ti.UI.SIZE
});

for (const name of ['alloy', 'android', 'ios', 'layout', 'listview']) {
  tags.add(Ti.UI.createLabel({
    text: name,
    left: 4,
    right: 4,
    top: 4,
    bottom: 4,
    color: '#fff',
    backgroundColor: '#4a4a4a'
  }));
}
```

Within a row, a child with neither `top` nor `bottom` is centred; with one of
them it aligns to that edge with that much padding; with both, the two are
treated as padding.

Set `horizontalWrap: false` and the children stay on one line instead, with
`left` and `right` acting as the gaps between them.

## Overlap and stacking

Composite layout lets children overlap. Later children draw on top of earlier
ones, and `zIndex` overrides that for siblings:

```js
const badge = Ti.UI.createView({
  width: 20,
  height: 20,
  borderRadius: 10,
  backgroundColor: 'red',
  top: -6,
  right: -6,
  zIndex: 1
});
```

Negative pins put a child outside its parent's bounds, which is how a badge
sits on a corner. On Android a child drawn outside its parent may be clipped,
so give the parent enough room rather than relying on the overflow.

## Reading a size back

`width` and `height` are what you asked for, not what happened. A view whose
width is `Ti.UI.FILL` reports `Ti.UI.FILL`, not a number. For the measured
result use `rect` or `size`, and only after the view has been laid out:

```js
view.addEventListener('postlayout', () => {
  Ti.API.info(`${view.rect.width} x ${view.rect.height}`);
});
```

`postlayout` fires whenever the view is measured, which is more than once. If
you only want the first, remove the listener inside it.

## Common mistakes

**A container sized `Ti.UI.SIZE` with no children** is zero by zero. Nothing is
wrong with the children you add later; they are inside a box with no area.

**`top` and `bottom` with a `height`** does not stretch. See the precedence
table above.

**Two `Ti.UI.FILL` children in a vertical layout.** The first takes the
remaining space and the second has none.

**Setting `layout` on the child.** It controls that view's own children, not
where it sits in its parent.

**A percentage against a `Ti.UI.SIZE` parent.** `'50%'` of a parent that is
sizing itself to its children is not a number anyone can compute, and the
result is not useful. Give the parent a real size first.
