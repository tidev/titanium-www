title: Lists & tables
description: ListView, TableView, and which of the two to reach for.
since: 13.4.0

Titanium has two scrolling list types. **Reach for `ListView`.**

`TableView` came first and builds one view per row, in JavaScript, and keeps
them all. `ListView` describes rows as templates that the native list recycles,
the way `UITableView` and `RecyclerView` do underneath. On a long list that is
the difference between a list that scrolls and one that stutters.

Neither is deprecated, and `TableView` is still the simpler thing to reach for
when a "list" is a settings screen of eight fixed rows. Past that, use
`ListView`.

## A list in three parts

A `ListView` holds `ListSection`s, and a section holds items. An item is plain
data, not a view: it says which template to use and what to put in it.

```js
const win = Ti.UI.createWindow({ backgroundColor: 'white' });

const section = Ti.UI.createListSection({ headerTitle: 'Modules' });
section.setItems([
  { properties: { title: 'ti.map' } },
  { properties: { title: 'ti.barcode' } },
  { properties: { title: 'ti.coremotion' } }
]);

const list = Ti.UI.createListView({ sections: [section] });

list.addEventListener('itemclick', (e) => {
  const item = e.section.getItemAt(e.itemIndex);
  Ti.API.info(`tapped ${item.properties.title}`);
});

win.add(list);
win.open();
```

`properties` sets properties on the row itself. With no template, `title` is
the one that shows.

## Templates

A template names the views in a row and gives each one a `bindId`. Items then
address those views by that id, so the data and the layout stay separate.

```js
const template = {
  childTemplates: [
    {
      type: 'Ti.UI.Label',
      bindId: 'name',
      properties: { left: 16, font: { fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 'bold' } }
    },
    {
      type: 'Ti.UI.Label',
      bindId: 'detail',
      properties: { right: 16, color: '#888', font: { fontSize: 14 } }
    }
  ]
};

const list = Ti.UI.createListView({
  templates: { row: template },
  defaultItemTemplate: 'row',
  sections: [section]
});

section.setItems([
  { name: { text: 'ti.map' }, detail: { text: '5.7.0' } },
  { name: { text: 'ti.barcode' }, detail: { text: '4.2.0' } }
]);
```

Each key in an item that is not `properties` or `template` is a `bindId`, and
its value is the properties to set on that view.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Row views are recycled. Every property a template sets on a row must be set
> by **every** item that uses it, or a row will inherit whatever the last item
> in that slot left behind. Set `color` on one item and not the next and the
> colour follows the recycled view down the list.

## Changing the contents

Replace everything with `setItems`. Add to the end with `appendItems`. Change
one row in place with `updateItemAt`, which is what to use for a checkbox or a
"favourited" state, because it does not rebuild the section.

```js
section.updateItemAt(0, { name: { text: 'ti.map' }, detail: { text: '5.8.0' } });
```

Sections are managed on the list: `appendSection`, `insertSectionAt`,
`replaceSectionAt`, `deleteSectionAt`.

## Which events fire

`itemclick` is the one you want, and it gives you `sectionIndex`, `itemIndex`,
`section` and `bindId` - the last being which view inside the row was tapped,
which is how one row can have a tappable button and a tappable body.

`scrollstart`, `scrolling`, `scrollend`, `dragstart` and `dragend` cover
scrolling. `marker` fires when a row you nominated with `setMarker` comes into
view, which is the hook for loading the next page of results.

## TableView

`TableView` builds rows as real views, so a row is a view you can hold onto and
change directly:

```js
const table = Ti.UI.createTableView({
  data: [
    { title: 'General' },
    { title: 'Notifications' },
    { title: 'Privacy' }
  ]
});

table.addEventListener('click', (e) => Ti.API.info(`row ${e.index}`));
```

That directness is the reason to use it for a short fixed list, and the reason
not to use it for a long one: nothing is recycled, so a thousand rows is a
thousand view hierarchies.

The event is `click`, not `itemclick`.

The same list of five items rendered twice, side by side: `ListView` on an
iPhone simulator and on an Android emulator, with a section header visible on
each so the platform styling of the header is the difference on show.
