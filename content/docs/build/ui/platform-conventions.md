title: Platform conventions
description: Where iOS and Android genuinely expect different things, and what to do about each.
since: 13.4.0

Titanium gives you one layout system and one API, and most of a screen is the
same on both platforms. This page is for the places where that stops being
true - where the platforms differ in *approach* rather than in a property name,
and where writing one behaviour for both produces an app that feels wrong on
one of them.

Small differences are noted on the page they belong to. These are the
structural ones.

## Navigating between screens

**iOS stacks windows.** A `NavigationWindow` owns a stack, pushes a window on
with `openWindow` and pops it with `closeWindow`, and draws a back button in
the bar automatically.

**Android stacks activities.** Opening a window starts an activity, the
hardware or gesture back closes it, and there is no navigation container to
create.

```js
const android = Ti.Platform.osname === 'android';

const root = Ti.UI.createWindow({ title: 'List', backgroundColor: 'white' });
const nav = android ? null : Ti.UI.createNavigationWindow({ window: root });

/** Opens a screen the way the platform expects. The one place that branches. */
function push(win) {
  if (nav) {
    nav.openWindow(win);
  } else {
    win.open();
  }
}

const open = Ti.UI.createButton({ title: 'Open detail' });
open.addEventListener('click', () => {
  push(Ti.UI.createWindow({ title: 'Detail', backgroundColor: 'white' }));
});
root.add(open);

(nav ?? root).open();
```

One `push` rather than a platform check at every call site.

## The back button

Android has one and iOS does not. That is a real difference in what a user can
do, not a styling choice.

```js
const win = Ti.UI.createWindow({ backgroundColor: 'white' });
let unsaved = true;

win.addEventListener('androidback', () => {
  if (!unsaved) {
    win.close();
    return;
  }
  const ask = Ti.UI.createAlertDialog({
    message: 'Discard changes?',
    buttonNames: ['Cancel', 'Discard'],
    cancel: 0
  });
  ask.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    if (e.index === 1) {
      unsaved = false;
      win.close();
    }
  });
  ask.show();
});

win.open();
```

Adding an `androidback` listener replaces the default behaviour, so the window
no longer closes unless you close it. That is the point of the event, and it is
also the way to leave a user trapped on a screen if you forget the other
branch.

The last window closing exits the app on Android. `exitOnClose` on the root
window controls that.

## Title bars

iOS has a navigation bar owned by the stack; Android has an action bar owned by
the activity. They take different properties.

| | iOS | Android |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Title | `Window.title` | `Window.title` |
| Custom view | `Window.titleControl` | `ActionBar.customView` |
| Hide it | `Window.navBarHidden` | `ActionBar.hide()` |
| Back affordance | Automatic | `ActionBar.displayHomeAsUp` |

`Window.title` is the one that works on both, which is why it is worth
building screens that need nothing more.

## Tabs

`TabGroup` is the same object on both platforms and lands in different places:
a bottom tab bar on iOS, and tabs the platform places according to its own
version on Android. Both are correct for their platform.

The thing not to do is force one. An app with iOS-style bottom tabs on Android
reads as a port.

Three to five tabs. Both platforms handle more badly, in different ways.

## Menus and actions

iOS puts secondary actions in the navigation bar or a toolbar. Android has an
options menu in the action bar's overflow.

There is no shared abstraction over the two. Either put the action somewhere
that exists on both - a button in the content - or write the platform-specific
version of each and pick with a check.

## Safe areas and system bars

iOS content runs under the notch and the home indicator unless told otherwise.
`extendSafeArea` on the window controls it, and defaults to letting the system
inset your content.

Android draws behind the status bar in some themes and not others. Set
`theme` on the window to choose.

Test both on hardware with a notch or a cutout. A simulator in the default
device rarely shows the problem.

## Which platform am I on

```js
if (Ti.Platform.osname === 'android') { /* ... */ }
```

`Ti.Platform.osname` is `'android'`, `'iphone'` or `'ipad'` - so a test for iOS
has to accept two values. In Alloy, `OS_IOS` and `OS_ANDROID` are compile-time
constants and the branch not taken is removed from the build rather than
evaluated at runtime.

In TSS and XML, a platform attribute does the same:

```xml
<Alloy>
  <Window>
    <Button platform="android" title="Android only" />
  </Window>
</Alloy>
```

Prefer those to a runtime check when the difference is layout rather than
behaviour: the code for the other platform never ships.

:::missing 4:3

The same two-screen app on an iPhone simulator and an Android emulator side by
side, on the detail screen, so the iOS back chevron in the navigation bar and
the Android up affordance in the action bar are both visible.
