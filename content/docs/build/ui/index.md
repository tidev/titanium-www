A Titanium view is a real native view. `Ti.UI.createButton()` makes a
`UIButton` on iOS and an `android.widget.Button` on Android, and you get a
handle to it. Nothing here is drawn by Titanium or approximated in a web view.

What Titanium adds on top is one layout system, shared by both platforms, so a
screen you describe once positions itself on either. That system is the first
thing to learn and the thing most new Titanium code gets wrong.

## Start here

[Layout and positioning](/docs/build/ui/layout) is the one to read first. Three
layout modes, two sizing constants, and a precedence order that explains why a
view you gave a `height` to ignored your `bottom`.

[Lists and tables](/docs/build/ui/lists) covers `ListView` and `TableView`, and
which of the two to reach for. The short answer is `ListView`.

[Icons and launch screens](/docs/build/ui/icons-and-launch-screens) is a
reference: what sizes each platform wants and where the files go.

[Platform conventions](/docs/build/ui/platform-conventions) is for the places
iOS and Android genuinely diverge, rather than the small differences that fit
in a note on the page you were already reading.

## The API reference is the other half

These pages explain how the pieces fit together. What every property does, on
which platform, and since which release is in the
[Titanium API](/docs/sdk), which is generated from the SDK itself and is
complete. When a guide and the reference disagree, the reference is right.
