description: Camera, photo library, audio, and video, and the permission each one needs first.
since: 13.4.0
---

Everything on this page needs permission before it works, and asking is your
job. A camera call with no permission does not throw: it fails quietly, or the
system dialog appears once and never again after the user says no.

## Ask first

Each capability has a matching pair of methods.

| Capability | Check | Ask |
| ---------- | ----- | --- |
| Camera | `Ti.Media.hasCameraPermissions()` | `requestCameraPermissions()` |
| Photo library | `hasPhotoGalleryPermissions()` | `requestPhotoGalleryPermissions()` |
| Microphone | `hasAudioRecorderPermissions()` | `requestAudioRecorderPermissions()` |
| Music library | `hasMusicLibraryPermissions()` | `requestMusicLibraryPermissions()` |

```js
function withCamera(done) {
  if (Ti.Media.hasCameraPermissions()) {
    done();
    return;
  }
  Ti.Media.requestCameraPermissions((e) => {
    if (e.success) {
      done();
    } else {
      Ti.API.warn('camera denied');
    }
  });
}
```

iOS also needs a usage string in `tiapp.xml`, or the app is rejected at review
and the dialog never appears:

```xml
<ios>
  <plist>
    <dict>
      <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
      <string>Attach a photo to a note.</string>
      <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
      <string>Choose a photo to attach to a note.</string>
      <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
      <string>Record a voice note.</string>
    </dict>
  </plist>
</ios>
```

Write the real reason. "Required by the app" is the string reviewers reject.

## The camera

```js
Ti.Media.showCamera({
  mediaTypes: [Ti.Media.MEDIA_TYPE_PHOTO],
  saveToPhotoGallery: false,
  success(e) {
    const image = Ti.UI.createImageView({ image: e.media, width: 200, height: 200 });
    win.add(image);
  },
  cancel() {},
  error(e) {
    Ti.API.error(e.error);
  }
});
```

`e.media` is a `Blob`. Assign it straight to an `ImageView`, or write it to a
file with `Ti.Filesystem`.

`saveToPhotoGallery` defaults to false, so a photo your app took exists only in
that blob until you save it somewhere. Write it to
`applicationDataDirectory` if it needs to outlive the screen.

Close the camera with `Ti.Media.hideCamera()` when you dismiss it yourself.

## The photo library

```js
Ti.Media.openPhotoGallery({
  mediaTypes: [Ti.Media.MEDIA_TYPE_PHOTO],
  allowMultiple: false,
  success(e) {
    Ti.API.info(`picked ${e.media.length || 1} item`);
  },
  cancel() {}
});
```

With `allowMultiple: true` the success event carries an `images` array instead
of a single `media`, which is the shape change to handle rather than assume.

## Audio

Three objects, for three jobs.

| Object | For |
| ------ | --- |
| `Ti.Media.Sound` | Short effects, held in memory |
| `Ti.Media.AudioPlayer` | Long files and streams |
| `Ti.Media.AudioRecorder` | Recording |

```js
const sound = Ti.Media.createSound({ url: '/audio/tap.wav' });
sound.play();

const player = Ti.Media.createAudioPlayer({ url: 'https://example.com/talk.mp3' });
player.addEventListener('change', (e) => Ti.API.info(e.description));
player.start();
```

`Sound` loads the whole file, so it is for something short. `AudioPlayer`
buffers, which is what you want for anything longer than a notification chime.

For audio that continues when the app is backgrounded, set
`Ti.Media.audioSessionCategory` and declare background audio in `tiapp.xml`.
Both are required; either alone stops the audio at the home gesture.

## Video

```js
const video = Ti.Media.createVideoPlayer({
  url: 'https://example.com/clip.mp4',
  width: Ti.UI.FILL,
  height: 240,
  autoplay: true
});
win.add(video);
```

A `VideoPlayer` is a view, so it lays out like any other and defaults to
filling its parent. Release it when the window closes: it holds a decoder, and
leaving it alive costs memory that the platform will eventually take back by
killing the app.

The camera overlay open on an Android emulator with the shutter visible, and
below it the captured photo shown in an ImageView on the same screen.

needs asking first.
