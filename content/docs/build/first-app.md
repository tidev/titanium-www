title: Your first app
description: Create a Titanium project, run it on a simulator, and install it on a real phone.
since: 13.4.0
---

Your toolchain works. This page turns it into a running app: a project on disk,
built and launched on a simulator or emulator, changed once so you can see the
edit loop, then installed on a real phone.

Budget twenty minutes. Most of it is the first build, which compiles the SDK for
your platform and is the slowest one you will run on this project.

If `ti info` still reports errors, fix those first. A build that fails because
setup is half finished reads like a Titanium bug and is not one. Go back to
[environment setup](/docs/setup) if you need to.

## Classic or Alloy

Titanium gives you two ways to write an app. Choosing now saves restructuring
later, and the choice is smaller than it looks.

**Classic** is plain JavaScript against the Titanium API. You build every view
by calling it: `Ti.UI.createWindow()`, `add()` its children, `open()` it. One
file, nothing to install.

**Alloy** is Titanium's MVC framework. Views are XML, styles are TSS, and
controllers are JavaScript. Alloy compiles those into Classic code at build
time, so it is a layer over the same API rather than a different runtime.

| Aspect | Classic | Alloy |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Install | Nothing | `npm i -g alloy` |
| One screen is | A `.js` file | An `.xml`, a `.tss`, a `.js` |
| Layout | JavaScript calls | XML elements |
| Styling | Object literals inline | TSS selectors in their own file |
| Data binding | Written by hand | Models and collections |
| Reuse | Functions | Widgets and controllers |

Choose **Alloy** for an app with more than a few screens. Splitting layout,
style and behaviour is what keeps a growing app readable, and the data binding
is work you would otherwise write yourself.

Choose **Classic** for a prototype, a single-screen tool, or when you want to
see exactly which API calls produce a screen.

Neither is a dead end. `alloy new` converts a Classic project in place, so
starting Classic and moving later costs one command.

Pick one now. Every tabbed block on this page follows that choice.

## Create the project

:::tabs

@tab Classic

```sh
ti create --type app --name Hello --id com.example.hello --platforms android,ios --workspace-dir .
```

@tab Alloy

Install Alloy once, globally:

```sh
npm i -g alloy
```

Then create the project and convert it in one step:

```sh
ti create --type app --alloy --name Hello --id com.example.hello --platforms android,ios --workspace-dir .
```

`--alloy` runs `alloy new` on the project after creating it. Without Alloy on
your `PATH` the project is still created, as Classic, and the CLI tells you what
to install.

:::

Run `ti create` with no arguments to be prompted for each value instead. The
flags above are what those prompts write, and every one of them is required:
outside of prompting the CLI has no default for `--type` or `--workspace-dir`.

Three of the values matter beyond this tutorial:

`--id` is the application id, reverse-DNS, and it becomes the Android package
name and the iOS bundle identifier. **Changing it later means a new listing in
both stores**, so use a domain you control rather than `com.example`.

`--name` is the project directory and the name under the icon.

`--platforms` accepts `android`, `ios` and `iphone`. Use `ios` for iPhone and
iPad. `iphone` targets iPhone only, and writes `ipad` as `false` in the
deployment targets.

You now have a `Hello` directory. [Project structure](/docs/build/project-structure)
is a tour of what is in it; the short version is that your code is in
`Resources` for Classic and `app` for Alloy, and `tiapp.xml` is the app's
configuration.

## Run it

```sh
cd Hello
```

Build for Android:

```sh
ti build --platform android
```

Or for iOS:

```sh
ti build --platform ios
```

That is the whole command. `--target` defaults to `emulator` on Android and
`simulator` on iOS, so with no other arguments Titanium compiles the app, starts
a device image, installs the app and launches it. With more than one emulator or
simulator available you are asked which to use; pass `--device-id` to skip the
question.

The first build takes several minutes. Later builds reuse most of that work and
take seconds.

:::unavailable ios

Building for iOS requires macOS. Xcode compiles, signs and installs iOS apps,
and Apple ships it only for Mac. Android builds work here as normal.

:::

The app opens on two tabs, each with a label. The build log ends with
`Project built successfully`, and the app's console output continues in your
terminal until you stop it with `Ctrl-C`.

To compile without installing or launching, add `--build-only`. It is the fast
way to check that a change compiles.

## Change something

Replace the contents of the file the template generated:

:::tabs

@tab Classic

`Resources/app.js`:

```js
const win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
  backgroundColor: 'backgroundColor'
});

const label = Ti.UI.createLabel({
  text: 'Tap the button',
  color: 'textColor',
  top: 40
});

const button = Ti.UI.createButton({
  title: 'Say hello',
  top: 100
});

button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  label.text = 'Hello from Titanium';
});

win.add(label);
win.add(button);
win.open();
```

Every view here is a function call, and `win.open()` is what puts it on screen.
`backgroundColor` and `textColor` are not CSS names: they are semantic colors
defined in `Resources/semantic.colors.json`, which resolve to different values
in light and dark mode.

@tab Alloy

`app/views/index.xml`:

```xml
<Alloy>
	<Window>
		<Label id="label" top="40">Tap the button</Label>
		<Button id="button" top="100" onClick="sayHello">Say hello</Button>
	</Window>
</Alloy>
```

`app/styles/index.tss`:

```tss
"Window": {
	backgroundColor: "backgroundColor"
}

"#label": {
	color: "textColor"
}
```

`app/controllers/index.js`:

```js
function sayHello() {
	$.label.text = 'Hello from Titanium';
}

$.index.open();
```

The three files are one screen. An element in the XML becomes the matching
`Ti.UI.create*` call, `id` in the view is `#id` in the TSS and `$.id` in the
controller, and `$.index` is the view's top-level element. `backgroundColor`
and `textColor` are semantic colors from `app/assets/semantic.colors.json`,
which resolve differently in light and dark mode.

:::

Build again and tap the button.

```sh
ti build --platform android
```

Rebuilding for every edit gets old quickly. Add `--liveview` and Titanium
reloads the running app when you save instead:

```sh
ti build --platform android --liveview
```

## Run it on a real device

A simulator does not tell you how the app feels, and it cannot test the camera,
GPS, notifications or real network conditions. Get onto hardware early.

### Android

Enable developer mode on the phone: **Settings**, **About phone**, then tap
**Build number** seven times. In the **Developer options** screen that appears,
turn on **USB debugging**. Connect the phone over USB and accept the
authorisation prompt it shows.

Check that Titanium sees it:

```sh
ti info -t android
```

The device is listed under **Connected Android Devices** with an ID. Then:

```sh
ti build --platform android --target device
```

With several devices attached, name one with `--device-id` and the ID from
`ti info`.

Android debug builds are signed with a development keystore Titanium generates,
so there is nothing to configure. Signing matters when you distribute.

### iOS

An iPhone needs a development certificate and a provisioning profile listing
that device before anything can install on it. If you set up signing while
[installing Xcode](/docs/setup/macos), that is already done.

Connect the phone, unlock it, and trust the computer when asked. Then:

```sh
ti build --platform ios --target device
```

Titanium reads certificates from your keychain and profiles from Xcode, picks
the pair that matches your app id, and prompts when more than one fits. Use
`--device-id` with the UDID from `ti info -t ios` to choose between devices.

The app stays installed until the profile expires. A free Apple ID gets seven
days, a paid developer account a year.

## Where to go next

You have the loop: create, build, change, rebuild. The rest of the guides fill
it in.

- [Project structure](/docs/build/project-structure) explains every directory
  the template made and what `tiapp.xml` controls.
- [User interface](/docs/build/ui) covers layout, lists and the places where
  iOS and Android genuinely differ.
- [Alloy](/docs/alloy) is the framework in depth: views, styles, models and
  widgets.
- The [API reference](/docs/sdk) documents every type and method, and is
  complete for every released version.

For a worked example larger than a tutorial, read
[kitchensink-v2](https://github.com/tidev/kitchensink-v2). It exercises most of
the SDK in one Alloy app and is maintained alongside it.
