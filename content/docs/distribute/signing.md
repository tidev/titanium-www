description: The signing identities each platform needs for distribution, and how to make them.

Development signing - getting a build onto your own device - is covered in
[environment setup](/docs/setup/macos). This page is the identities you need to
give a build to somebody else.

## Android: a keystore

A keystore is a file you generate once and keep for the life of the app.

```sh
keytool -genkey -v -keystore myapp.keystore -alias myapp \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

`keytool` ships with the JDK, so it is already on the machine.

> [!WARNING]

> passwords with it.** Google Play identifies your app by its signing key. Lose
> the keystore or its password and you cannot ship an update - not with a
> support ticket, not with anything. The app has to be republished under a new
> id, losing its listing, reviews and installs.

> Do not commit it. A keystore in the repository is the signing identity of

Build against it:

```sh
ti build --platform android --target dist-playstore \
  --keystore /secure/myapp.keystore --alias myapp --output-dir ./dist
```

The CLI prompts for the password. `--store-password` exists for CI, where it
should come from a secret rather than a shell history.

Save the path and alias so you stop retyping them:

```json
{
  "titanium.android.keystorePath": "/secure/myapp.keystore",
  "titanium.android.keystoreAlias": "myapp"
}
```

That is the VS Code extension's settings. The password is asked for each time
and is not stored.

### Play App Signing

Google Play can hold the signing key for you: you sign with an upload key, Play
re-signs with the real one. It removes the catastrophic-loss problem, because
an upload key can be reset by support.

Turn it on when you first publish. It cannot be added to an existing app
without Google's involvement.

## iOS: a certificate and a profile

Two things, and both come from Apple.

A **distribution certificate** identifies you. One per team, reused across
apps, valid for a year.

A **provisioning profile** ties a certificate to an app id and, for ad-hoc
builds, to a list of device UDIDs. One per app per distribution method.

Make them in Xcode - **Settings, Accounts, Manage Certificates** - or in the
developer portal. Xcode is less error-prone because it puts the private key in
your keychain at the same time.

Titanium reads certificates from the keychain and profiles from where Xcode
keeps them, so anything Xcode can see it can use:

```sh
ti info -t ios
```

That lists the certificates and profiles it found, with their UUIDs. It is the
fastest way to answer "which profile does it think it has".

```sh
ti build --platform ios --target dist-appstore \
  --distribution-name "Apple Distribution: Example Ltd (ABCDE12345)" \
  --pp-uuid 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 \
  --output-dir ./dist
```

Set `ios.distributionName` in
[CLI configuration](/docs/reference/config) to stop passing the certificate
every time.

### The private key is the part that matters

A certificate without its private key is useless, and the key lives in the
keychain of the machine that made the request. Moving to a new machine means
exporting a `.p12` from the old one, not downloading the certificate again.

Export it when you create it, not when you need it.

## Which target signs with what

| Target           | Signing                          | Produces                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `device`         | Development                      | An app on the connected device |
| `dist-adhoc`     | Distribution + ad-hoc profile    | `.ipa` for named devices       |
| `dist-appstore`  | Distribution + App Store profile | `.ipa` for upload              |
| `dist-playstore` | Your keystore                    | `.aab` for upload              |
