 * The two unpinned spellings of "the current release notes".

 * `/docs/sdk/release-notes` cannot be a page the way `/docs/sdk/Titanium.UI.Window`
 * is - there is nothing for it to render that is not already at a version. The
 * fold above would therefore send `/docs/sdk/latest/release-notes` to
 * `/docs/sdk/release-notes`, which resolves as a type named `release-notes` and
 * 404s. These two rules come first so it lands on the newest note instead.
 *
 * The target is the newest version that *has* a note rather than the newest
 * release. They are the same version today, and they are not in the window
 * between a release shipping and its notes being captured - that is a
 * deliberate step, `scripts/capture-release-notes.ts`. Reading the notes on
 * disk means that window lands on the last real note rather than on a 404.
 *
 * Both spellings, because the unversioned one is what anybody gets by trimming
 * the version out of a URL, and the site's own rule is that unversioned means
 * latest. Temporary for the same reason as the fold: the destination moves with
 * every release.

 *
 *   /docs/latest/...  the spelling people type. Never a built page, here or in
 *                     the reference.
 *   /docs/v14/...     the current major named explicitly. Real while v14 is
 *                     current only as a redirect; it becomes a set of built
 *                     pages the moment v15 ships and v14 is snapshotted.
 *   /docs/v11/...     a major that fell out of the retention window. Its pages
 *                     are gone, and the same page in current is the closest
 *                     true answer.
 *
 * All temporary. Every one of these rules moves when a major ships, and a
