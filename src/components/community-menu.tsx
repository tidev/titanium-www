/**
 * The one dropdown in the header.
 *
 * ## A disclosure, not a `menu`
 *
 * The WAI-ARIA menu pattern - `role="menu"`, `role="menuitem"`, arrow keys
 * capturing focus - is for menus of *commands*, the way a desktop application's
 * File menu is. This holds links. Marked up as a menu, a screen reader would
 * announce four "menu items" that are really destinations, and `menuitem`
 * suppresses the link semantics the reader needs to know they are about to
 * navigate away. So this is a disclosure button revealing an ordinary list of
 * ordinary links, which is what APG recommends for navigation and what Tab
 * already moves through correctly.
 *
 * ## Opening it
 *
 * Hovering opens it, and that has to be the *least* of the ways in, because
 * hover is the one input not everybody has. Three others reach the same state:
 *
 *   - **Focus.** Tabbing to the trigger opens it, so a keyboard user never has
 *     to guess that the button does something a mouse would have revealed.
 *   - **Tap.** A touch tap fires `pointerenter` before `click`, so the menu is
 *     already open by the time the click lands. The click handler therefore
 *     *opens* rather than toggling - toggling would close, on the same tap, the
 *     menu the tap just opened.
 *   - **Escape**, which closes and hands focus back. The half people forget: a
 *     keyboard user who dismissed the menu with focus still inside it would
 *     otherwise be tabbing through a hidden list.
 *
 * Below `md` this is not rendered at all - the drawer in `mobile-nav.tsx` lists
 * Community as a heading with its links under it - so the tap path is for the
 * touch-capable laptops and tablets that land on the desktop layout.
 */

/**
 * How long the menu survives the pointer leaving it.
 *
 * The trigger and the panel do not touch: there is a few pixels of gap, and
 * crossing it means leaving both. Without this the menu would close on the way
 * to its own contents. It also forgives the diagonal, which is how people
 * actually travel from a word to the third item under it.
