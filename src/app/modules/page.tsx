 * Every module anyone has published, of either kind.

 * carrying the `titanium` topic, which is the closest thing Titanium has to a
 * module registry - the list is what tidev/module-search-www served, taken over
 * so there is one place to look rather than two.
 *
 * Read from `registry/modules/` on disk - no network at build time, which is
 * what keeps rebuilds fast and preview deploys reproducible.
