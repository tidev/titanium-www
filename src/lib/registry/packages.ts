 * upstreams are unreachable and two builds of one commit produce one page.
 * Refreshed with `pnpm registry:cli`.
 *
 * ## Two upstreams, and which one owns what
 *
 * **GitHub owns the releases.** `tidev/titanium-cli` publishes one release per
 * version with a written body, which is the opposite of the SDK - all 71 SDK
 * release bodies are empty or a link back to this site, which is why those
 * notes are captured into pages here (see `docs/release-notes.md`). The CLI's
 * are worth reading where they are, so `date` and `url` come from GitHub and
 * the site links out to them.
 *
 * **npm owns `engines.node`.** That is a fact about a published package rather
 * than about a release, it is the input to `minimumCli`, and npm carries it for
 * all 191 versions where GitHub has releases for only the most recent 46 -
 * including the 3.x and 5.x the compatibility table still reasons about.
 *
 * So an entry is keyed by version and carries what each upstream knows about
 * it. `date` and `url` are absent on the versions that predate the repository's
 * releases, which is what marks a version as published to npm and nowhere else.
 *
 * Nothing else is kept from either. The packument is megabytes of dist tarball
 * metadata and a GitHub release is mostly actor and asset records; storing
 * either whole would put a moving upstream document under version control.
